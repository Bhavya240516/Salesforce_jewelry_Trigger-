# Salesforce_jewelry_Trigger-
I created an Apex Trigger as part of the CRM Application of Jewel Management on the Jewel_Order_Item__c object. Its purpose is to automatically update the Total Amount on the parent Order__c record whenever a line item is created, updated, or deleted. This ensures the order total is always correct.
